TIBCO Rendevous
===============

TIBCO's Rendevous product is a popular low latency point-to-point (unicast) and broadcast (multicast) communications platform.
Its interoperability (C, C++, Java, COM & .NET) have made it popular especially in the Captial Markets (Investment Banking) industry for distributing trade and price information internally.

The .NET Api is a fairly cumbersome port from I assume Java. To get decent support you need to login to the TIBCO website with account information that is not often available to the "Developer on the floor".
This only makes things more difficult to get right.
The aim of these snippets is to allow you to use TibRv with Rx and to follow the general principals of lazy evaluation and deterministic clean up.
